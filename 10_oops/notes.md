## Does Javascript have OOP

Yes, JavaScript supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It is a multi-paradigm language, meaning it supports procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming styles.
JavaScript fully supports OOP principles, but it is prototype-based rather than class-based (like Java or C++). The ES6 class syntax makes OOP in JavaScript more readable and structured, but under the hood, everything is still based on prototypes.

## Javascript have classes?

Yes, JavaScript has classes!

Classes were introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) as syntactic sugar over JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance. While JavaScript remains prototype-based, classes provide a cleaner, more readable way to create objects and manage inheritance.
However, under the hood, JavaScript still uses prototypes. Classes are just a more intuitive way to work with objects and inheritance.
